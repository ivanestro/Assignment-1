## First git status output:
git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        README.md
        
        
## Second git status output:

 git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   README.md

## Purpose of the following Commands:

- `mkdir`: Make a new directory
- `cd`: Change in directory
- `code`: Opens a visual studio code.
- `ls`: List all the folders in this specific directory

## Why Version Control is Important

With version control, it is possible to:

- Tracks all the changes made to the files and directories.
- Can backup and recover previous version of files. 
- Can be used to collaborate with multiple users without conflicts.
- Enable users to combine different changes with different branches to prevent conflicts.

## Purpose of the following Git Commands

- `git init`: to initialize repository.
- `git status`: to get what your current status is.
- `git add`: what changes you made in a file but will not be automatically tracked this is where git commit does 
- `git commit`: Create a meaningful messages to the changes.
- `git push`: save the changes in the remote repository 
- `git pull`: to fetch changes from remote and merge them in repository.
- `git log`: displays all of the commits in git repository showing all the details such as messages, Authors, Date and so on.
- `git branch`: a listing of all repository can be used without a branch name.
- `git merge`: is used to combine different branches into a single branch.
- `git checkout`: is used to switch different branches.

## My Unique Touch

There are things that set me apart from others:

- This is a new branch which is unrelated to the main branch
- People can work on multiple branches and this new-branch is me if I had a person who will work on a new branch it will be new-branch2
- Can be merged in the main branch
- Does not affect peoples work.
